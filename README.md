**Technologies Involve**
>Project is created with `Python3.8.2` using [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) module


**Installation**
> To run this project, download and install `YSetup.exe` locally on your system 

**How to run**
>Installing setup leads to `Maze Solver` file, which contains a `input.txt` file. In this file you need to put matrix of nxn size and have to double click on `mazesolver.bat` if you were using windows or `mazesolver.sh` if you were using linux to get the output matrix(which comes up in the `path.txt` file).

>A demo matrix is already present in `input.txt` file, you just need to overwrite it.
